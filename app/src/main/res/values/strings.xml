    <string name="bale_full_article_example">Tottenham have re-signed Wales forward Gareth Bale from Spanish champions Real Madrid on a season-long loan.
        \n\nBale, 31, left Spurs for a then world record £85m in 2013 and went on to score more than 100 goals and win four Champions Leagues with Real.
        \n\n"It\'s nice to be back. It\'s such a special club to me. It\'s where I made my name," said Bale.
        \n\n"Hopefully, now I can get some match fitness, get under way and really help the team and, hopefully, win trophies."
        \n\nSpurs said Bale has signed for them with a knee injury sustained playing for Wales earlier this month and they "anticipate that he will be match fit after October\'s international break".
        \n\nThat would mean the forward missing their next five games, with the club\'s first outing following the international break at home to West Ham on 17 October. </string>
